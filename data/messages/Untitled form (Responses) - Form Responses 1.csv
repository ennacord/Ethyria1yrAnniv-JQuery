10/3/2022 8:40:02,Enna,"The world is a miserable place, but at least Enna Alouette exists.' 

I've watched plenty of YouTube videos, but none of them were able to make me genuinely laugh except for yours, Enna! I've never thought that after a dreadul day, I was excited to watch your videos that bring joy to me. I too think, that the world is a miserable place and often wish that I was just a cat, but you are one of the reasons why I continue to do what I have to do. I enjoy your negative talks about life (especially during the trial by trolley collab), perhaps because I relate to those negative thoughts too. But of course, I wish you well and hope that lesser negative thoughts surround you!  

Thank you for bringing joy to Aloupeeps, Enna! I wish you good health, and I wish you to have a great life, because you have brought joy to thousands! Thank you for being part of Ethyria, and being part of Nijisanji! 

Happy 1 year anniversary Ethyria! ",Yeou Yuko,Yeowoo #9313

Doesn't even feel too long since I first watched your debut. But looking back, a lot of great things happened. Thank you so much for all the joy, love and positivity you guys spread. I feel so blessed and happy to have known you all, as it made me finally take a step forward in my life. Especially you Enna! From your chaotic energy, gameplays, and collabs to relaxing, motivating, and super funny talks and antics. I've never felt as genuinely as I did to work hard until you pushed me. Seeing the amount of growth you've gone through, and hard work you put out as well within the year, I can't tell you how proud I am to be an aloupeep and call you my oshi. Though now I've been pretty busy, and only sometimes get to catch your streams, and hardly get the chance to make fanarts of you, I'll always support and love you, and all the other members of Ethyria and EN too.
